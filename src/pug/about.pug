                            | “Iridescence” is defined as bright, luminous, multi-colored hues that shift and transform upon being viewed from different angles.To us, the multi-colored, rainbow-like nature of “iridescence” represents diversity and open-mindedness and connotes our ability, as humans to adapt and change. We intend for the art studio to be a constant, reliable environment that can bring a sense of normality, stability, and comfort amidst our chaotic world. At Art Club, HKUSU, therefore, we hope to uphold, enlighten and bring out the attributes of “iridescence” in all of our members.
